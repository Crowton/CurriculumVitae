I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from Aarhus University, supervised by Gerth Stølting Brodal.
My focus has been on Algorithms and Data structures, with a further focus on I/O efficiency and persistence.

\medskip
During my time at Aarhus University, I have spent many years as a Teaching Assistant (TA), with many of these as a lead TA.
I have, as part of this work, been the exam contact person a few times for written exams, where I handled error clarifications and collecting the repsonses.
Further, I have helped proofreading written exams sets for both errors and clarification issues. 
This gave me a lot of usefull insight into how exams are executed, and how the evaluation process works.
Additionally, my work with TA'ing have given me knowledge on how to grade handins, and how to ask questions in a manner understandable to the students.
