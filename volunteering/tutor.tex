\cvevent{Tutor}{Mat/Fys-Tutorgruppen, Aarhus University}{January 2018 -- Present}{Aarhus, Denmark}
As a tutor, I have planned and executed a welcome program for new students
of the university, including guidance and social events.

\medskip

As part of the tutoring work, before the students arrive, I have helped
creating new tasks for the try-TA session inclueded in the introductory
week, as well as work on the guide book for the tutors.
