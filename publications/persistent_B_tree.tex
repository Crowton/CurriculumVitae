% Abstract: We present the first fully persistent external memory search tree achieving amortized I/O
% bounds matching those of the classical (ephemeral) B-tree.  The insertion and deletion of elements in any version
% requires amortized $O(\log_B N)$ I/Os and a range query in any
% version requires worst-case $O(\log_B N + K/B)$ I/Os, where $K$ is
% the number elements reported, $N$ is the number of elements in the
% version of the tree queried or updated, and $B$ is the external
% memory block size. The data structure requires space linear in the
% total number of updates. Compared to the previous best bounds for
% fully persistent B-trees [Brodal, Sioutas, Tsakalidis, Tsichlas, SODA 2012], this paper
% eliminates from the update bound an additive term of $O(\log_2 B)$
% I/Os. This result matches the previous best bounds for the restricted case of partial
% persistent B-trees by Arge et al. 
% Central to our approach is to consider the problem as a set of two dimensional rectangles that
% can be merged and split.
