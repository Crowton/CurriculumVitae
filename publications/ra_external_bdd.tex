% Abstract: The external memory BDD package Adiar can manipulate Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) larger than
% the RAM of the machine. To do so, it uses one or more priority queues to defer processing each
% recursion until the relevant nodes are encountered in a sequential scan.

% We outline how to improve the performance of Adiar's algorithms if the BDD width of one of its
% inputs is small enough to fit into main memory. In this case, one of the algorithms' priority
% queues can entirely be replaced with (levelised) random access to the nodes of the narrow BDD.
% This preserves the I/O efficiency of the original algorithm, is applicable to other types of
% decision diagrams, and significantly improves performance for many larger BDD computations.
